# About

Demos and various algorithms in C++.
In some instances code could be "smarter", however a simpler code, walkthrough approach was chosen to demonstrate algorithms.

### - memoized fibonacci
A recursive function that returns the nth Fibonacci number, using Memoization *(optimization technique that caches computationally expensive functions)*

###- number
Reads a number from <code>string</code><br/>
algorithm assumes the string contains at least 1 valid digit

###- suffle
Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle algorithm<br/>
Takes as input an array of <code>int</code> elements, max & low boundaries 
<code>min <= rand &lt; max</code>

###- timer
A high resolution timer class (WIN32 API)

###- reverse int
Reverses digits of an integer (negative / positive & checks for overflow)

###- palindrome int
Determines if an integer is palindrome
